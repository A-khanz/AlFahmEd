<h1> What Is a Fiqh ?</h1>

<p> <b>FIQH </b>means Jurisprudence. It means the rules and orders of Shariah (Islam)on certain things based on the <b>Imaams</b> and .<b>School of thoughts</b>. 
In Islam there are only <b>4 School of Thoughts </b> i.e (Madh-habs) مذاهب . Out of these 4 It is an order by the Prohpet to <b>only</b> follow<b> 1</b> of these as preffered.
All of these 4 Imaams and their thoughts (مذهب) are TRUE and therefore cannot be denied or refuted </p> 

<p> Shaafi'i Madh-hab is one of them that is based on Imaam Muhammadush Shaafi'i (الإمام محمد الشافعي) school of thought (فقه). Followers of this imaam are reffered to as Shaafi'i Madh-hab (مذهب الشافعي). This school of thought / Jurisprudence came into existence from Imaam Shaafi'i (رضي الله عنه) . Imaam Shaafi'i (رضي الله عنه) School of thought was the 3rd School of thought out of the 4 Schools / Jurisprudence. </p>
